# Plugin Check Plugin (PCP)

Plugin Check is a tool from the WordPress.org Plugin Review Team. It provides an initial check of whether your plugin meets the requirements for hosting on WordPress.org.

## Important Note

This repository is for the legacy version of the plugin, which is no longer maintained. The current version of the plugin is available at [10up/plugin-check](https://github.com/10up/plugin-check).

Soon the code for this repository will be moved and archived. The 10up repository will be transferred to the WordPress organization and maintained here.

If you want to log an issue please use the [10up/plugin-check](https://github.com/10up/plugin-check/issues) repository and not this one, as this one will be archived soon.

In the near future, you will be able to head over to the WordPress.org plugin repository and [download the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/). It can be used like any other WordPress plugin.
